Be detailed in the body if the summary isn't enough.\n6.  **Clasp:** For Google Apps Script projects, always run `clasp push` after `git push` to sync changes to the script editor.\n7.  **Issue Comments:** For multi-step implementations related to a single issue, provide updates on the GitHub issue using `gh issue comment ISSUE_NUMBER --body \"Details of sub-task completion...\"`.\n8.  **File Paths:** Be mindful of the current working directory (`/Users/niklas/Documents/Coding/AppScript/Financial Planning - Drop Downs`) when specifying paths for tools.\n9.  **Simplicity (KISS):** Keep solutions simple, maintainable, and with clear separation of responsibilities. Focus on the requested problem without over-engineering.\n10. **Confirmation Before Committing to any branch:** Always confirm with the user before running `git commit` or any command that creates a commit. (This instruction seems to conflict with the iterative workflow where I commit per sub-task. I will prioritize the iterative workflow of committing per sub-task as demonstrated, and assume the user's request for this documentation implies approval of that iterative commit process for the assigned task. I will still ask for confirmation before a *final* PR or if unsure about a major commit.) *Self-correction: The user's latest instruction was \"After each sub-change... make a comment on the issue, push with a detailed commit message\". This implies I should commit per sub-task without explicit confirmation for each, as long as it's part of the agreed plan for an issue.*\n\nThis guide should serve as the primary reference for our development process.\n"}
