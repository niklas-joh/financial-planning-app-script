Summary of changes...\" --reviewer \"username\"`\n\n10. **Await Feedback/Merge:**\n    *   The user or team will review the PR.\n    *   Address any feedback by making further commits to the same branch and pushing.\n\n11. **Post-Merge (If applicable):**\n    *   The branch will typically be deleted automatically by GitHub if configured, or manually.\n    *   The issue will be closed (often automatically if linked correctly in PR, or manually).\n\n## IV. Cline's Specific Instructions & Reminders for this Workflow\n\n1.  **Terminal Commands Suffix:** Always append `&& sleep 5` to terminal commands executed via `execute_command` tool. This ensures I can view the full output.\n2.  **`cline/` Directory:**\n    *   This directory is for my temporary analysis files or files I need to generate (like issue bodies).\n    *   **Crucial:** Always delete files created in `cline/` (e.g., `cline/issue_body.md`) once they have served their purpose (e.g., after an issue is created). This directory is in `.gitignore`.\n3.  **Issue Creation:** When creating an issue, use a descriptive title following conventional commit type (e.g., \"Feat(Analysis): Enhance sheet with X\"). Use labels like `enhancement`, `bug`, `chore`, and component-specific labels if known (e.g., `analysis-sheet`).\n"}
