(e.g., `feature/31-enhance-analysis-metrics`).\n\n4.  **Implement Changes (Iteratively per Sub-Task):**\n    *   Focus on one sub-task or logical change at a time.\n    *   Write or modify code.\n    *   Test changes locally if possible (e.g., by running the script/application).\n\n5.  **Commit Changes:**\n    *   **Cline Action:** Stage relevant files: `git add <file1> <file2> ...`\n    *   **Cline Action:** Commit with a descriptive message following Conventional Commits: `git commit -m \"type(scope): Description of changes for this sub-task\"`\n\n6.  **Push Changes:**\n    *   **Cline Action:** Push the local branch to remote: `git push origin <branch-name>`\n    *   **Cline Action (For AppScript):** Push changes to Clasp: `clasp push`\n\n7.  **Update GitHub Issue (Optional, for multi-commit tasks):**\n    *   **Cline Action:** If a significant sub-task is completed within a larger issue, comment on the GitHub issue: `gh issue comment ISSUE_NUMBER --body \"Update: Completed sub-task X (e.g., 'Refined data extraction logic'). Changes pushed.\"`\n\n8.  **Repeat Steps 4-7 for Remaining Sub-Tasks.**\n\n9.  **Final Review & PR (Once all sub-tasks for the issue are complete):**\n    *   Ensure all code adheres to project standards.\n"}
