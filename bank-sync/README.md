# Bank Sync

Modular Apps Script project that pulls bank data via
[Enable Banking](https://enablebanking.com) into a dedicated Google Sheet
("Bank Sync"). Independent of the legacy `src/` project in this repo.

## Layout

```
bank-sync/
  .clasp.json     this project's script (run clasp from this folder)
  src/            pushed to Apps Script (rootDir)
  test/           Node unit tests, never pushed
```

Pure logic (normalisation, FX, dedupe) has no Apps Script dependencies and is
tested locally: `npm test` (Node 20+).

## One-time setup

1. `clasp login` (opens a browser). Enable the Apps Script API at
   https://script.google.com/home/usersettings.
2. From this folder: `clasp create --parentId <SHEET_ID> --title "Bank Sync" --rootDir src`
   to bind a script to the Sheet, then `clasp push`.
3. In the Apps Script editor, open Project Settings, then Script Properties,
   and add:
   - `EB_APP_ID`: your Enable Banking application ID
   - `EB_PRIVATE_KEY`: the full text of the downloaded `.pem` (PKCS#8,
     including the BEGIN/END lines)
   - `EB_REDIRECT_URL`: the redirect URL registered for the application

## Secrets

The application ID and private key live only in Script Properties. Never put
them in the repo, logs, sheets or chat. `.gitignore` excludes `*.pem`, `*.key`,
`.env`, `client_secret*.json` and `.clasprc.json`. Tests and docs use fake data.

## Workflow

Feature branch per module, small PRs, conventional commits, never push to main.

## Connecting Revolut (Phase 1)

1. `clasp push`, then `clasp deploy` once. The web app runs as you and is
   accessible only by you. Its redirect URL is
   `https://script.google.com/macros/s/<DEPLOYMENT_ID>/exec`.
   After later code changes, redeploy to the *same* deployment with
   `clasp deploy -i <DEPLOYMENT_ID>`, otherwise `/exec` keeps serving the old version.
2. In the Enable Banking Control Panel, set the application's redirect URL to
   that `/exec` URL.
3. Add the three Script Properties (see above). `EB_REDIRECT_URL` must equal the URL from step 2.
4. Reload the Sheet. In the **Bank Sync** menu: *Show status*, then
   *Authorize Revolut*, open the link and log in. The redirect lands on the web app,
   which stores the session and shows the consent expiry.
5. *Refresh accounts & balances* writes the `raw_accounts` and `raw_balances` tabs
   (IBANs are masked to the last four characters).

First run from the editor (e.g. `onOpen`) once so Google can ask you to grant the scopes.

## Transactions (Phase 2)

*Bank Sync > Sync transactions* writes the `transactions` tab (one row per
provider + account + transaction id; amounts signed, expenses negative).

- First run fetches the last 90 days; later runs restart each account at its
  latest booked date minus 7 days, so late-booked items and pending to booked
  changes are picked up. Re-running never duplicates rows.
- Fetches go oldest to newest in 31-day windows and the tab is saved after each,
  so a run that reaches the time budget (4.5 min) loses nothing. Run it again to
  continue.
- Pending rows inside a re-fetched window that the bank no longer returns are
  removed (they booked under a new id or were cancelled).
- `amountEur`, `fxRate` and `fxRateDate` stay empty until the FX phase and are
  preserved on re-sync.
- Ids: `entry_reference`, else `transaction_id`, else a content hash.
